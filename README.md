Here's a step-by-step guide to help you run the application.

### Prerequisites
1. *Node.js and npm*
2. *Git*

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing <repository-url> with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone:

sh
git clone <repository-url>


This will create a directory named repo-name in your current directory.

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the directory of the cloned repository:

sh
cd repo-name


#### 3. Install Dependencies
Before running the app, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Ensure you are in the project directory and run:

sh
npm install
npm install react-router-dom
npm install firebase


This command reads the package.json file and installs all the dependencies listed under dependencies and devDependencies.

#### 4. Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Run the following command:

sh
npm start


This command typically runs the react-scripts start script, which starts the development server and opens the React app in your default web browser. You should see the app running at http://localhost:3000.


### Summary
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd repo-name
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Start the development server: npm start

Following these steps you can run the web application smoothly. Happy coding!
